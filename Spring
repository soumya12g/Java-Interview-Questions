Difference between @RestController and @Controller?
@Rescontroller responses will be of http response view, where as controller response will be string and we need to add one more annotation(@ResponseBody)
  @Controller
    Purpose: Used to mark a class as a Spring MVC controller.
    Usage: Typically used in traditional web applications to return views (like JSP, Thymeleaf).
    Return Type: Methods in a @Controller can return a ModelAndView object, which includes both the model data and the view name.
                 for it to get requires pattern response
  @RestController
    Purpose: A specialized version of @Controller used to create RESTful web services.
    Usage: Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, meaning that the return value of the methods is directly written to the HTTP response body.
    Return Type: Methods in a @RestController typically return data (like JSON or XML) directly.
2.Advantage of spring over spring mvc?
3.Design pattern related questions?
Transaction propagation in springboot?
Given Employee and department class, without modifying these classes how can we establise relationship 
between these two, so that department can hold all of its employees and we can return all of its employee given department object.
